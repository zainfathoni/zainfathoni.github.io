Since I read [Akbar](http://www.akbargumbira.com)'s [first post](http://www.akbargumbira.com/welcome-ghost/index.html) in his blog which is freely hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I've been wanting to try the same thing. He uses [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) as his blogging platform and [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster/) as his static pages generator.

However, seeing that the [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster/) last commit is **more than a year ago**, I became hesitate to use it. Though, it's a sign that I can embrace the opportunity to be an active contributor for it. But I am not confident enough take that opportunity yet, due to my lack of knowledge & experience in Node.js (the Ghost's programming language) & Python (the Buster's programming language).  :D

After wandering for some time, finally I found another blogging platform as an alternative. It's called [TinyPress](https://tinypress.co/). I am curious about how good it is. The only way to satisfy my curiosity is by trying it by myself, haha.. And...

***Voila!!..*** This is my first post using [TinyPress](https://tinypress.co/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
